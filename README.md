# isGWAS: ultra-high-throughput, scalable and equitable inference of genetic associations with disease

This is the repository for the **isGWAS** algorithm introduced in the preprint linked [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.21.550074v3).

**isGWAS** is a optimisation algorithm that ingests sample-level data to rapidly compute accurate estimates of genetic-disease associations. 

Key impact areas include:
- Rapid GWAS enabling WGS and NGS-level analysis across millions of individuals in minutes; 
- Avoids the need to acquire/access expensive individual-level data and can operate efficiently with sufficient statistics;
- Enables privacy-preserved data sharing and collaboration opportunities;
- Enables biobank design by forecasting disease association for arbitrary sample sizes.

This code repository is currently **under development** but you can use the algorithm and test your hypothesis at the following website: [https://www.optima-isgwas.com/](https://www.optima-isgwas.com/).
